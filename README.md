> Unofficial, Reverse-Engineered Python client for Meta's [Threads](https://threads.net).

Inspired by [NPM Threads-API](https://github.com/junhoyeo/threads-api)

# Threads API - Python

Threads API is an unofficial Python client for Meta's Threads API. It allows you to interact with the API to login, read and publish posts, view who liked a post, retrieve user profile information, follow/unfollow and much more.

It allows you to configure the session object. Choose between:
* `aiohttp` - Python library to ease asynchronous execution of the API, for âš¡ super-fast âš¡ results. (*default*)
* `requests` - Python library for standard ease of use (supports `HTTP_PROXY` env var functionality)
* `instagrapi` - utilize the same connection all the way for private api
* (Advanced) Implement your own and call ThreadsAPI like this: `ThreadsAPI(http_session_class=YourOwnHTTPSessionImpl)`

> **Note** Since v1.1.10 you can use `requests` or `instagrapi` as HTTP clients, not just `aiohttp`.

> **Note** Since v1.1.12 a `.session.json` file will be created by-default to save default settings (to reduce risk of being flagged). You can disable it by passing `ThreadsAPI(settings_path=None)`

> **Important Tip** Use the same `cached_token_path` for connections, to reduce the number of actual login attempts. When needed, threads-api will reconnect and update the file in `cached_token_path`.

## Getting Started

### ðŸ“¦ Installation
```bash
pip install threads-api
```
or
```bash
poetry add threads-api
```

Example using threads-api to post to Threads.net:
``` python
from threads_api.src.threads_api import ThreadsAPI
import asyncio
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

async def post():
    api = ThreadsAPI()
    
    await api.login(os.environ.get('INSTAGRAM_USERNAME'), os.environ.get('INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD'), cached_token_path=".token")
    result = await api.post(caption="Posting this from the Danie1/threads-api!", image_path=".github/logo.jpg")


    if result:
        print("Post has been successfully posted")
    else:
        print("Unable to post.")
    
    await api.close_gracefully()
    

async def main():
    await post()

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Customize HTTP Client
Each HTTP client brings to the table different functionality. Use whichever you like, or implement your own wrapper.

Usage:
``` python
api = ThreadsAPI(http_session_class=AioHTTPSession) # default
# or
api = ThreadsAPI(http_session_class=RequestsSession)
# or
api = ThreadsAPI(http_session_class=InstagrapiSession)
```

## Set Desired Log Level
Threads-API reads the environment variable ```LOG_LEVEL``` and sets the log-level according to its value.

Possible values include: ```DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL```

**Log Level defaults to WARNING when not set.**

Useful to know:
``` bash
# Set Info (Prints general flow)
export LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

``` bash
# Set Debug (Prints HTTP Requests + HTTP Responses)
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```
